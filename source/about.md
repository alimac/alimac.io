My first languages were Polish and Perl.

If you subscribe to [Sapir-Whorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity)
then those two are to be believed to be quite influential to my world view.

My first website venture was a greeting card site powered by a Perl CGI script.
It was called _Awangarda XX Wieku_ (Avantgarde of the 20th Century), a name
inspired by a book (_Brulion Bebe B._ by MaÅ‚gorzata Musierowicz).
With me, all things are inspired by books. Even my last name.

Equal parts system administrator and web developer, I enjoy writing, editing and
distilling words, and code.

Oh, and conifers > deciduous.
