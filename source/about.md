My first languages were Polish and Perl.

My first website venture was a greeting card site powered by a Perl CGI script.
It was called _Awangarda XX Wieku_ (Avantgarde of the 20th Century), a name
inspired by a book (_Brulion Bebe B._ by Małgorzata Musierowicz).
With me, all things are inspired by books. Even my last name.

When I am down I reach for _Pamiętnik Narkomanki_ by Barbara Rosiek. Like
a friend, hand in hand, it walks me through dark moments. When I need strength
_Kochanek Wielkiej Niedźwiedzicy_ by Sergiusz Piasecki is at my side. Together,
we slip past border guards like shadows in the night.
When I need a distraction I bury myself in _Wiedźmin_ series by Andrzej Sapkowski.
Opened on any page, it makes time disappear, like magic.

Equal parts system administrator and web developer, I enjoy writing, editing and
distilling words, and code. If I am not writing it down, I am not learning.
If I am not learning, I am doing it wrong.

If I was not working in information technology, I would probably repair elevators.
I find them fascinating.
