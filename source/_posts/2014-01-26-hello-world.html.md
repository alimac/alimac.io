This is my attempt at blogging with the static site generator [Middleman][].
The inspiration for this project is Julie Pagano's post:
[Site Redesign Using Middleman][] which I'm using as a template and springboard
for:

* learning about static site generators
* learning and practicing CSS with SASS and Compass
* practicing using git
* getting more comfortable with Markdown

I also want to document my adventures with:

* Drupal
* Chef
* devops practices in general
* contributing to open source projects
