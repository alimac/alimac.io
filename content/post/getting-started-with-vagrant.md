The year was 2013. The place was BADCamp. As I wandered from session to session
I kept hearing about Vagrant, a free open source tool for creating and
configuring disposable virtual environments.

Shiny! But, I didnâ€™t know anything about it.

So, over the last year I challenged myself to learn to use Vagrant in Drupal
core development and other projects. In this talk I would like to introduce you
to working with Vagrant:

* What is Vagrant and why you might want to use it
* New vocabulary! what are providers, provisioners, boxes
* Vagrant and Drupal
* Common problems you might encounter when working with Vagrant and tips to make your experience with Vagrant better
* Vagrant resources

If you have used Acquia Dev Desktop or MAMP/WAMP/XAMPP and want a more flexible
virtual environment for your projects, or are simply curious about working with
Vagrant and want to get a solid overview, this talk is for you.
