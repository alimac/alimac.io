Drupal Core Mentoring has become immensely popular since the idea of online
office hours first came about in July 2011.
<!--more-->

Soon after, mentoring at Drupal
events came on the scene at DrupalCon Denver, then Munich in 2012. To ease
new contributors into the Drupal contribution workflow, every DrupalCon since
then has included Core Mentored Sprints and First Time Sprinter Workshops.

We will show examples of how to apply the key components of Drupal Core
Mentoring to mentoring inside organizations:

* starting small
* talking in "public"
* asking questions
* breaking down problems
* giving and taking feedback
* working together
* moving on

If you are thinking of starting mentoring in your organization, or already have
a mentoring structure in place, come to this session.
