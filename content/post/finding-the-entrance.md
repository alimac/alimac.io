In June I was honored to be invited to present the keynote at St. Louis DrupalCamp.
<!--more-->

The camp was dedicated to the memory of [Eric Brown](http://ericthelast.org/)
(<i class="fa fa-drupal"></i> ericthelast), who was the cornerstone of
the St. Louis Drupal Users Group and was instrumental in organizing St. Louis’
first inaugural DrupalCamp.

The title, _Finding the entrance_ was inspired by a quote:

> When you develop an interest, it usually comes from an environment that de-dramatizes things. Because then you’re able to find your own entrance into it.
> &mdash; [Robyn](http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/746-what-happens-when-there-are-no-boys-in-the-room-a-report-from-robyns-tekla-conference/)

In the talk, I gave a brief introduction to the Drupal community and
the benefits of becoming involved. I highlighted local, regional and
international community members and their thoughts about how they got involved,
how they contribute, and what they have learned. I closed by listing 19
ways that people can become involved in the community.
