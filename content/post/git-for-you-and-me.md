Git is a way to document changes to code or text (or code and text). It also
makes it easy to explain the changes and possible to back out of them.

<!--more-->

Git can be used by solo developers or teams. It can be used to track a code project,
or a novel. We will talk about:

* The goals of version control
* Setting up your git preferences (per repository, or global)
* Creating a repository (or removing a respository from a directory)
* The three sidekicks: status, log, and diff
* **Backing out of things**
* Branches
* Methods of merging work
* Resources for learning git
