Drupal Core Mentoring has exploded since the idea of office hours first came
about in July 2011.

Mentoring at events came on the scene at DrupalCon Denver and DrupalCon Munich
in 2012, then in Sydney in early 2013. Every DrupalCon since then has included
Core Mentored Sprints and First Time Sprinter Workshops to ease new contributors
into the Drupal contribution workflow.

In this session we will review the history of how Drupal mentoring has existed
in the past and how it has changed since then, including ongoing core mentoring
office hours taking place online. We will present a few points which represent
a vision for the future of mentoring, with links to existing issues to help
implement them where applicable.

## Vision

* Contribution process is more transparent, and mentors do not spend most of
their time explaining drupal.org and drupal.org work arounds.
* Mentors actually do real mentoring
* Becoming a mentor is easy to do
* Experienced mentors return to do mentoring at events

## Measures of successful mentoring

* number of people attending mentored events (IRC, DrupalCon mentored sprints)
* new contributor experience
* percentage of new contributors that become repeat contributors

Then, we will talk about the barriers to realizing the vision. And, we will
finish with some actionable steps that will get us closer to that vision.

Presenters will include people with experience with different aspects of
mentoring: in person at small events, in IRC office hours, in the issue queues,
and at DrupalCons.
