Scalability is the ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work,
or its ability to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. What then, is
burnout at scale?

Many of the current discussions about burnout focus on solutions aimed at
the individual. Can burnout be approached as a structural issue, instead
of an individual one? And, can we find solutions to prevent or mitigate
burnout that can scale to meet organizational needs?

The aim of this talk is to encourage you to think about systemic approaches
to burnout.

* Identify mismatches between a job and a person that can lead to burnout
* Understand the dimensions of burnout
* Learn about the processes that organizations can take to address burnout
